Common Support Issues

This document is a guide to common issues that are raised by patients through Patient experience team (PTX).

# 1. Order stuck in "Awaiting token" status:
WHY: The order can be stuck in "Awaiting token" status due to the following reasons: 
- The patient profile is missing information, such as address.
- The patient profile is not updated in the system.

## How to resolve:
- Check the patient profile, specially the address section. You can do that search the patient profile by using the patient code in the database.
- If the patient profile is missing information, such as address, you should update the patient profile in the system before action in the order.


# 2. Revert patient discharged:
WHY: The need to revert the patient discharge is due to the following reasons:
- The patient wants to be reinstated in the system.
- The patient was discharged due to an human error.

## How to resolve (steps):
1. Check the patient profile if the patient is inactive. 
2. Check why the patient was discharged. If the patient has a reason "Medical condition", you should let the patient know that the revert is not possible.
3. Only revert the patient discharge if the discharge reason is not equal to "Medical condition".
